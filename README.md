Perfect is a new framework for building server side applications in swift. Visit [perfect.org](http://www.perfect.org) and get the source code from github.

This is my attempt to boilerplate a "Hello World" Project. Please find the guide on my blog [Hello World Guide to Perfect Server](http://code-me-dirty.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/creating-perfect-swift-server.html)

Please visit the project on [github](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) form more information and play with the [examples](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect/tree/master/Examples).
